                <p>FBB was founded in 2005 by way of a grassroots effort.  Many retired peace corp volunteers began and continue to run this program, though as the word spreads about the support they provide the composition of their board of directors includes a wider variety of backgrounds.</p>
                <p>As an organization that provides educational and community support by way of scholarships & grants, the intentions and effects of Full Basket Belize's work are well aligned with those of Access to Opportunity.</p>

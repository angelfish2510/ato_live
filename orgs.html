                  We have several programs that help us address the threats affecting our coral reefs. Our aim is to keep tourists coming to our island. <br> 

                  A Board of Directors, that is comprised of member tour operators, defines broad strategic direction and goals for the organization. They also ensure good leadership and strong board-functioning. A Program Director coordinates the implementation of our core programs with support from volunteers and collaborators.</p>

            <h3>Current Campaign</h3>
            <h4>Belize Marine Ecosystem Education program (BMEE)</h4>

            
              <p>Members of SPTOA have designed a program to educate the youth in San Pedro about the components of the marine ecosystem, how life progresses through the marine environment, and why protecting this ecosystem is critical to the future.<br><br> 

                Each Saturday, up to 20 young children in San Pedro will participate in a Saturday Academy.  They will be led and taught by a SCUBA diving professional along with an intern assistant.  The program will begin with approximately 2 hours exploring and learning about the role of the mangrove habitat as the nursery for most coral reef sea life.  Next will be approximately 2 hours exploring and learning about the shallow grassy plains between the shore and the coral reef.  Last will be approximately 2 hours at the Hol Chan Marine Reserve to see the coral reef ecosystem in action.  Snacks will be provided for the participants.</p>
